## Overview

Iridology, the study of iris patterns to understand systemic health, has always been a manual and subjective process. With **Praneonâ€™s AI Vision Model**, we're integrating technology with traditional diagnostics, bringing precision and scalability.

## Key Features
- Iris Image Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
- Pattern Recognition with AI-trained neural networks
- Real-time Health Analysis Dashboard
- Cloud-integrated Case Management System

## My Role
As a BNYS intern with a passion for innovation, I led the concept development, research, and collaborated on the AI training pipeline, ensuring clinical accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow)
- Next.js Frontend for visualization
- Firebase for backend integrations

## Challenges & Learnings
- Data scarcity of annotated iris images
- Ensuring AI interpretations align with holistic diagnostic principles
- Bridging the gap between clinical relevance and technological innovation

## Next Steps
We are piloting the AI Iridology Assistant across wellness clinics, aiming for seamless practitioner integration and better client outcomes.
